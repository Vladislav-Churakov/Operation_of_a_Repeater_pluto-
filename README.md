Demonstration of Repeater Operation
The video demonstrates the operation of a repeater, specifically the transmission of a generated signal from a Pluto device and its reception on a HackRF with demodulation. The signal is received without errors, but there are a few nuances:

Low Transmitter Power: The transmitter's power is relatively low, which means that to transmit signals over long distances, it is necessary to develop or add a Low Noise Amplifier (LNA) to boost the signal strength.

Signal Inversion Issue: Occasionally, the received signal is inverted, meaning that where there should be zeros, there are ones, and vice versa. This occurs because when the phase of the received signal is −𝜋, the demodulator inverts the entire signal. 
This can be corrected by implementing an algorithm that checks if the phase of the received signal is −π. If so, the signal should be multiplied by −1 to correct the inversion.
